    <h2>What is a data breach?</h2>
    <p>A data breach happens when <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-personal-information/">personal information</a> is accessed, disclosed without authorisation, or is lost. For example, when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a USB or mobile phone that holds an individual’s personal information is stolen</li>
        <li>a database containing personal information is hacked</li>
        <li>someone’s personal information is sent to the wrong person</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A data breach can harm an individual whose personal information is affected. They can, for example, suffer distress or financial loss.</p>

    <p>There are <a href="respond.html">things you can do</a> to reduce your risk of harm. And, there’s help available if you suffer distress.</p>
