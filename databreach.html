<h3>Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme</h3>

<P>What is a data breach?
A data breach happens when [personal information | https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-personal-information/] is accessed, disclosed without authorisation, or is lost. For example, when:
-a USB or mobile phone that holds a individual’s personal information is stolen
-a database containing personal information is hacked
-someone’s personal information is sent to the wrong person

A data breach can harm an individual whose personal information is affected. They can, for example, suffer distress or financial loss.

There are [things you can do | respond.html] to reduce your risk of harm. And, there’s help available if you suffer distress.
